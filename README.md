# Vue 3 Step by step project

## Installation

If you have node, you'll get a CLI called "serve". So, in order to boot up your app,
go to the root of the project in the terminal and then run:

```bash
> npx serve

# or

> serve
```

This will boot up a server on port 3000 and you can see your application
up and running. 

But, because this project contains a fake API you might install a package called `json-server` you should run:

```bash
> yarn && yarn start

# or 

> npm install && npm run start
```
